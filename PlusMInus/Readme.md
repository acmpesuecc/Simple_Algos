## Problem statement

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  6 places after the decimal.

e.g., array =[1,1,0,-1,-1] i.e., n=5 elements

so positives= 2/5, negatives= 2/5 and zeros = 1/5

then Output :
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
